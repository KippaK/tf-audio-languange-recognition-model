## Objective 
Spoken Language Identification (LID) is defined as detecting language from an audio clip by an unknown speaker, regardless of gender, manner of speaking, and distinct age speaker.

## Available models and languages
**FLEURS dataset** downloads can be found here: [Downloads](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/xtreme_s)

## Environment Setup
The models are implemented in PyTorch.
To use all of the functionality of the library, you should have:</br>
pytorch==2.8.0</br>
numpy==2.4.0</br>
tensorflow-datasets==4.9.9</br>
soundfile==0.13.1</br>

## Gantt chart for project planning
The project schedule and milestones are documented in an Excel Gantt chart.
You can open it directly from OneDrive:
